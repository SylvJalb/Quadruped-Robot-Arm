# Quadruped Robot (Only front right leg)

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer
Please note: I have just started to learn how to use Blender. The 3D drawings are not yet completed! Any informative comment, or participation in the project is welcome ;)

## Software
I use Blender to design my project. You can import in your Blender the "fullArm.blend" file.

## Actuators
For the actuators I use the opensource OpenTorque Actuator project made by [Gabrael Levine](https://hackaday.io/project/159404-opentorque-actuator).
I use more particularly the redesigned OpenTorque Actuator, by the Youtuber [Skyentific](https://www.youtube.com/c/Skyentific), then redesigned again by [RevisonNr3](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5155183) / [acisre](https://discourse.odriverobotics.com/t/opentorque-project-new-design/8280).
Finals Actuators STL Files are in the folder "openTorqueFiles".

## TO DO LIST :
- [x] Import the Opentorque remaked project in my 3D plan.
- [x] Draw the shoulder in 3D
- [x] Draw the arm in 3D
- [x] Draw the forearm in 3D
- [ ] Validate the full 3D plan by a pro.
- [ ] Print all, and make it.
- [ ] Develop sofware to move the leg.
